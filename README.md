## Spritesheet Cutter

This project uses [Sprite Cow](https://github.com/jakearchibald/sprite-cow) as a base for sprite selection. It is extended with spritesheet cutting and export features.

### Development

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:1234`

### Todo
- [x] Export individual selected sprites as PNG
- [x] Preview panel for selected sprite
- [ ] Zoom in/out

### Ideas
- [ ] Right-click to export
- [ ] Shift to select multiple sprites and export all
- [ ] Adjustable rectangle after selection
- [ ] Grid-based slicing
